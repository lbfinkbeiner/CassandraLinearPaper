* Get speed plots
	* Get 3k, 4k, 2k emu's
* Describe the available functions.
* I STILL need to build a testing pipeline for the codes as
	a whole...

Emu generations
Massive
	* 5k: A
	* 4k: B
	* 3k: C
	* 2.5k?
Massless
	* 5k
	* 4k
	* 3k
	* 2.5k?

Try going down first in steps of 500, then if the error
is too bad, reverse in steps of 250. The steps should not
be smaller than this, I think.

I change my mind, let's first test 2k after 3k, and interpolate from there...
